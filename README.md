Compared to the blog post, you will notice that I have added a clean version of the datasets. I tried to obtain better results by cleaning the train, validation and test datasets (removing URL, abbrevations....), but did not achieve a better ranking ðŸ¤·
Check the cleaning script [here](https://github.com/ferdi05/kaggle-disaster-tweet-competition/blob/main/clean_tweets.py)
